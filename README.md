> Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural
networks have not been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates
that a recent model that combines boosting with interpretability, auto-
matic piecewise linear regression (APLR), offers the best fit for predicting
learning satisfaction among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through
the analysis of APLR’s numerical and visual interpretations, students’
time management and concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to
classmates, and participation in offline courses have the most significant
positive impact on learning satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in cre-
ative activities did not positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover,
the contributing factors can be interpreted on an individual level, allow-
ing educators to customize instructions according to student profiles.
